### Hi there, I'm Guilherme 👋

I'm a Brazilian 🇧🇷 Software Engineer based in Tokyo, Japan 🇯🇵. I'm currently working with a great team at [Konfetti](https://github.com/Konfetti-GmbH/) 🎉.


“If your goal is innovation, then your role must instead be to create an environment—a setting, a context, an organization—where people are willing and able to do the hard work of innovation themselves: to collaborate, learn through trial and error, and make integrated decisions.”

― Linda A. Hill, Collective Genius: The Art and Practice of Leading Innovation
